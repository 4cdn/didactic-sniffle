# see docs/hooks.txt for a detailed description about the hook configuration syntax.

# if SRNd is configured to chroot into its data directory (which is the default and recommend) you can only use paths inside the data directory.
# basically you have three options:
# a) let your webserver access $SRNd_data_directory/plugins/overchan/out (recommend), or - if your webserver chroots itself for example -
# b) create a (hard) link in $SRNd_data_directory/plugins/overchan/out pointing to a directory which is readable by your webserver and
#    writeable by the user SRNd runs with (usually "news")
# c) link $SRNd_data_directory/plugins/overchan/out to a remote server, via sshfs or nfs for example

#start_param template_directory=plugins/overchan/templates
#start_param output_directory=plugins/overchan/out
#start_param database_directory=plugins/overchan
#start_param temp_directory=plugins/overchan/tmp
#start_param invalid_file=invalid.png
#start_param no_file=nope.png
#start_param document_file=document.png
#start_param debug=2
